    <h3>Privacy Policy for LocalContactForms.com</h3>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>LocalContactForms.com</strong>
      (“<strong>LocalContactForms</strong>”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects,
      processes, and protects personal information submitted through hosted contact
      forms and through our subscription-based services. It also explains how
      <strong>{{ data.clientName || 'our client' }}</strong> (“<strong>Client</strong>”)
      may use the information once they receive it.
    </p>

    <p>
      LocalContactForms provides hosted forms and communication tools used by
      businesses to receive inquiries from customers and visitors. When a user submits
      a form, LocalContactForms processes that submission and delivers it to the Client
      identified on or near the form.
