        <h3>Privacy Policy for LocalContactForms.com</h3>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>LocalContactForms.com</strong>
          (“<strong>LocalContactForms</strong>”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles
          information submitted through contact forms hosted on our platform, and
          describes in general terms how
          <strong>{{ data.clientName || 'our client' }}</strong>
          (“<strong>Client</strong>”) may use information once they receive it.
        </p>

        <p>
          LocalContactForms provides hosted contact forms that businesses can use to communicate with current and potential clients. When you submit a form, your
          information is processed by LocalContactForms and then made available to the
          Client whose name appears on or near the form.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Who Is Responsible for Your Data?</h3>

        <p>
          For each contact form:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>LocalContactForms</strong> acts as a
            <em>service provider / processor</em> that securely receives, processes,
            and routes your submission on behalf of the Client.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>{{ data.clientName || 'The business listed on the form' }}</strong>
            acts as the <em>controller</em> of the data you submit. They decide how to
            use, store, and retain your information in their own systems.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Questions about how your information is used after it is received by the
          Client should be directed to:

        <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>

        <p>
          LocalContactForms may share data only in the following situations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>With the Client who owns the form you submitted</li>
          <li>With trusted service providers who host, support, or maintain our platform</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          {{ data.clientName || 'The Client' }} may share your information consistent

        <h3>5. Data Storage and Retention</h3>

        <p>
          LocalContactForms stores form submissions in secure systems and generally
          retains them for as long as necessary to provide the service to the Client,
          maintain appropriate backups, and support the security and integrity of our
          platform, or as otherwise required by law.
        </p>

        <p>
          {{ data.clientName || 'The Client' }} may also store your information in email,
          customer relationship management (CRM) tools, or other business systems, and
          may keep it according to their own retention policies and legal obligations.

      <section class="app-dialog-section">
        <h3>6. Security</h3>

        <p>
          We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to help
          protect information processed through LocalContactForms, including encrypted
          connections (HTTPS) and access controls designed to limit access to authorized
          personnel and systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once your information is delivered to {{ data.clientName || 'the Client' }},
